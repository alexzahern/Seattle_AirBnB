# Seattle_AirBnB

This repository contains the Project "Write a Data Science Blog" of the Data Scientist Udacity NanoDegree. In this project the implementation of the CRISP-DM process will be evaluated: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation and finally the deployment will be assesed with a Medium Blog Post.

The libraries used were:
pandas for data analysis
matplotlib for visualization
numpy for numeric calculus and data analysis
seaborn for visualization
textblob for processing textual data

The submition consist of: 

Project_AirBnB_Alex_Zambrano.ipynb, a notebook where all the steps of the CRISP-DM process were detailed.
Thre .csv files: reviews_seattle,calendar_seattle,listings_seattle that contain the data to be analized.
map.png, an png image of Seattle.

After having carried out the analysis we found out that:

1. There is a correlation between the subjectivity of a review and the positivity of that review, besides most reviews are positive.
2. Location is the feature that impacts pricing the most
3. If you want to visit Seattle on a low budget, you should go in January and stay in South Delridge.
4. Offering a cheap location doesn't waranty whole year occupancy but the increase in price increases also the chances of your place being available for longer
5. It seems that adjusting prices according to season is not a common practice.
